<p>Museums, performance venues, arts groups, botanical gardens, zoos, and more &mdash; New York City's cultural organizations are the lifeblood of the city. Serving communities across the five boroughs, they've been an inspiration to generations of New Yorkers from artists and musicians to scientists and historians. They create jobs, attract visitors to local businesses, provide educational opportunities, and enrich our lives. They make New York City great.</p>
<p>Operating support from the city helps make it possible. But more can be done. Tell City Hall that you place a high value on these organizations and artists and that communities, students, seniors, and local businesses will benefit from an increased investment of $40 million in New York City's 1,500+ cultural organizations in all five boroughs.</p>

<p>"QBG would not be the beautiful place it is without the local community, namely volunteers from Korean Community Services. Their daily, tireless devotion to us and the community is a great example of the spirit in which we create lasting friendships throughout the Garden!"
</p>
<p>-Karl McKoy, Gardener, Queens Botanical Garden</p>
</div>

<div class="clutureBlocks"><img src="img/Whitney-Somewhere-Dariel-Sneed.jpg" >

<p>"I remember stepping into Times Square for the first time. I was ten and visiting with my family from California. I grew up with cerebral palsy, and the idea of becoming a performer was far fetched. But​ standing in the middle of that frenzied arena, I was sure I could be anything I wanted because I matched its energy deep down inside."

<div class="clutureBlocks"><img src="img/Avi-Keeper-with-Aldabra-Tortoise.jpg" >

<p>"When I was a kid, my parents and grandparents brought me to the Bronx Zoo all the time.  The conservation work I saw happening at the zoo as a child really impacted me, and led me to my current career.  Today, I'm responsible for the care of our colony of Kihansi spray toads, an extinct-in-the-wild species that we breed here so they can be reintroduced to their native habitat in Tanzania. It's an inspiring experience for me not only to contribute to the survival of an entire species, but to pass that inspiration along to visitors of all ages and backgrounds." <!-- New York City's wildlife parks are centers of science and education, where city residents and guests from all over the world are introduced to wildlife conservation and the incredible animals with whom we share our planet. --></p>

<p>"As Director, I am always looking for ways to bring in more support to the Garden so we can do all the 
wonderful things we dream up. I came to New York just after college and was struck by the diversity of this great city. I realized that part of the charm of the city was also, for me, the charm of plants—the diversity in the Plant Kingdom and how people around the world use plants, has always been fascinating to me. And this Garden which is in one of the most diverse places (Queens!) in the world—is truly the place where people, plants, and cultures meet!" 

</p>
<p>-Susan Lacerte, Executive Director, Queens Botanical Garden</p>
</div>

<div class="clutureBlocks"><img src="img/Luise-Schwabe_CREDIT-Anne-Tan-Detchkov.jpg" >

<p>"Before I volunteered at QBG I had no idea how much this Garden means for the borough of Queens, and I wish more people would appreciate its valuable presence. The Garden provides the community with open space, flowers and trees, fresh farm produce. It teaches children and adults about nature, gardening, composting, trains young adults for green jobs, and connects visitors with artists and their work. The list can go on, and yes, I am very impressed with the dedication and creativity of management and staff who tirelessly work at being of service to the people in Queens and beyond."

<p>"One of the most exciting things about my work is hearing from parents that their child—who absolutely would NOT eat vegetables—now gobbles up the veggies that he or she grew and picked in the Children’s Garden! These kids are so engaged with the land and the produce they are growing. They go back to school with a new enthusiasm for digging and growing vegetables, and learning more about insects and birds..."

<p>“I settled in New York City over twenty years ago after growing up in three different continents and traveling much of the world and this country. I thrive on culture, the arts, and diversity, and now I can't imagine living anywhere else. Here, I am inspired by culture daily: in the streets, the subways, and people's apartments; from the small music clubs and art galleries to the storied institutions like the Metropolitan Opera, The Museum of Modern Art, and the Village Vanguard. To me, this is what sets New York City apart from any place in the world.”

<p>"I'm from Florida and I have lived in New York for thirteen years. I love my home state, but I moved to NYC so I could immerse myself in and add to the mosaic of various cultures that are here. I am inspired by the virtuosic teenagers dancing on the trains and by the staged dances I see in theaters. I am fed by the music I hear blaring from my neighbors' open windows in Brooklyn, and by the concertos by professional musicians. In New York I eat it all, I see it all, I hear it all--perfect for an artist!"</p>

<p>"When you see yourself on the walls and your story is told,
you can't help but be inspired and want more. Access to
cultural programs fills my soul, I am grounded and have wings
at the same time. Cultural programming open doors and tell a
necessary global story.”</p>
<p>-Debbie Quiñones. Vice-Chair, Community Board 11</p>
</div>    

<div class="clutureBlocks"><img src="img/amymiller.jpg" >

<p>"I am constantly inspired by the notion that artists have the incredible capacity to create 'something' from 'nothing.'  I revel in the concept that we can walk into an empty studio and yet magically fill the space with new ideas, pave new connections and seemingly generate more LIFE out of thin air!  The really astounding thing is that this ability is not only realized by artists - this possibility is open to anyone who sees it, notices the opportunity and makes change HAPPEN!"</p>

</div>

<div class="clutureBlocks"><img src="img/michelewilson.jpg" >

<p>"Hailing from a small town in upstate NY, my entire perception of the world was changed when I moved to NYC ten years ago.  The sites, sounds, free performances, open exhibits, public art - everything about this city inspires me.  I love stumbling upon a new garden with Friday afternoon theater performances or an impromptu jazz concert on a street corner.  You can feel the vibrancy of our community humming."</p>

<p>"I was born and raised in Brooklyn where I have been involved in a community education program at Brooklyn Botanic Garden for over ten years; first as a student and volunteer, later as an intern, and finally as an employee. I had the opportunity to grow-up in a living museum surrounded by a multitude of flora that changes with every season and among educators that have a passion to teach youth from across the five boroughs about environmentally sustainable living practices. BBG has inspired a little  boy from Brooklyn to give back to the community and to pass on the torch of knowledge to those that will come after"</p>

<div class="clutureBlocks"><img src="img/Rujeko_Hockley.jpg" >

<p>"I grew up in New York, and in its cultural organizations. I didn't know what a curator was then, but I knew that I loved cultural expression; I loved history; I loved people; I loved to be compelled and moved, by beauty or complexity or pure heart; and I loved creativity, whether in myself or others. I knew that I wanted to live my life surrounded by these things, and that I wanted to contribute to increasing their impact and frequency in the world. As a curator, this is what I get to do every day."</p>

<p>"The support and perspective of LMCC, Figment and others [helped with] expanding my perspective and artistic vision, and I have been working now as a Professional Theater Director for over 15 years. As an Interactive Artist and Theater Director, I believe deeply that all people are creative and get them to play in theatrical contexts to give them an opportunity to see that in themselves.  NYC arts organizations have transformed my practice and given me the chance to dream big by allowing me to increase my impact on the community of NYC. We are all here to inspire and empower each other."</p>

<p>"When I was 14, I was a summer intern at the Bronx Zoo, tending to the small animals in the Children's Zoo and caring for (and getting spit on by) the camels in their barn. Ever since then, I've wanted my work to have meaning, to give something back to the world. I feel so lucky that my career is about helping to protect the planet's amazing animals."</p>

<div class="clutureBlocks"><img src="img/DanielSilva.jpg" >

<p>"Growing up in Spanish Harlem and the Bronx, I dreamed of living in a
 museum. As I got older, the goal changed to simply working in one. After interning at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The American Museum of Natural History while I was a student at the New York City Museum School, I was inspired to become an art history major at Baruch College (CUNY). It paid off. Today, I get to work with an eclectic collection of artifacts relating to film, television, and digital media that everyone can relate to."</p>

    <p>Sign your name in support of New York City's 1,500+ cultural organizations.</p>
<div id="PetitionLetter"> 
<p>The Petition</p>      
    <div id="LetterContent">
<p>Dear City Hall,</p>
 
<p>New Yorkers from all walks of life are inspired by New York City arts and cultural organizations in a myriad of ways. To support these organizations, I am writing today to respectfully request that you increase funding for arts and culture in New York City by $40 million.</p>
<p>New York City's arts and cultural organizations, including both the Cultural organizations Group and Program Groups, are essential to the fabric of this City -- they enrich the lives of New Yorkers in all five boroughs, provide significant economic impact through jobs and support for local neighborhoods, and help make the City's diverse communities more vibrant. </p> 
<p>Arts and cultural organizations would use this funding to increase lifelong arts and cultural education, expand access to arts and cultural opportunities, and support workforce development and diversity in the arts and cultural sector. These new funds could support increased funding for arts and cultural organizations, including underfunded groups, arts councils administering grants to individual artists and local cultural organizations, and a more diverse array of new grantees.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage the City to recognize the important, unique, and essential role that arts and cultural organizations, as well as individual artists, play in the lives of New Yorkers.</p>
